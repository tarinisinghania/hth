<h3 style="color:rgb(248, 250, 251);"> In chakra meditation, within the body there are seven primary energy points called the chakras, and each chakra is linked with some kind of quality or condition of the person. When these chakras are open it means energy can flow through them and this is good for the body, emotions and soul. Every chakra has its own benefit or worth when the chakra is healthy. For example, the Crown Chakra (which is called the void) is association with inner peace. But, when it is blocked or imbalanced, like daily alcohol dependence or presumably some other detrimental elements, people seem hard-pressed to having a feeling of serenity. This blockage may cause sensation of isolation, perplexity, or psychological distress.
    I mean to use the values to convey two sides of the picture of how having a healthy chakra works and what happens if it doesnâ€™t. I want my design to be different in every entry and convey the feeling of the value. I am not trying to give a chakra meditation guide but a different take on that.
