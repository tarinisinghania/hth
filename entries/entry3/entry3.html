<h1>CREATIVITY</h1>
<p>It is the seat for pure knowledge and innate creativity, providing us with our sense of aesthetics, art, music, and our appretiation and connection with nature.</p>
<span><p>It looks after our digestive organs. Bad digestion means bad swadishthan(located below navel) which eventually leads to a creative block.</p></span>
<div><p> When clear - creativity flows spontaneously and we are inspired. 
    When not - overthinking </p></div>
