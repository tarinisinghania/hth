    <div class="text"><p>Situated below the SACRUM BONE, the awakened MOOLADHARA CHAKRA
        fills us with innocence and wisdom, bringing with it a joy and wonder devoid of 
        conditionings and prejudice - a quality found in small children.
        This generally dimishes as we grow and develop ego and self-centered desires. Fortunetly 
        this quality can return, like the sun shining after the passing of heavy clouds. 
        DO YOU BELEIVE THAT BEING INNOCENT IN OUR GENERATION CAN BE CONSIDERED A GOOD THING?
