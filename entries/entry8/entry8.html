    <h1>SAHASRARA</h1>
   <div class="text">Our entire subtle system is integrated in the SAHASRARA CHAKRA, and each chakra has its seat here. As our attention rise to the Sahasrara we enter a new dimension of consciousness. We rise above the three channels of the subtle system- beyond the past, present and future - into a timeless state to experience the peace of the spirit.
    The opening of this chakra is known as SECOND BIRTH. Our human birth can be likened to the birth of an egg and Self realisation to the breaking of the egg and the birth of the bird. This is why an egg is given at Easter, to symbolise the unawakened state of man. </div>
