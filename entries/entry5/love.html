        <div class="main"><p>It is said that the heart is where our 'True Self' resides. When our heart is awakened it connects us to an unlimited source 
            of Love for ourselves and for others. It provides us with innate security and joy. Do you beleive that an individual can be
            independent of their situation in Life just by having a 'pure heart'?
